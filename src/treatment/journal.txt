When asked what threat led to last Friday's US drone strike, he told Fox News: "I can reveal that I believe it probably would've been four embassies. The killing of Gen Qasem Soleimani, a national hero, came after days of protests at the US embassy in Baghdad. But Democrats given intelligence briefings on the fatal strike say they have seen no evidence of embassy plots. Mr Trump first made the embassy claim at the White House on Thursday and repeated it that night at a rally in Ohio. He was also backed up by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. We had specific information on an imminent threat and those included attacks on US embassies. Period, full stop, said Mr Pompeo as he announced new sanctions against Iran. Mr Trump referred to the US embassy protests as evidence of an imminent Iranian plot. However, those protests had ended by the time the US launched a drone attack on Soleimani's motorcade at the Baghdad airport.
