1: BBC : UK : 10/01/2020: Qasem Soleimani: Iran was targeting four US embassies, says Trump :Foulen Ben Foulen : Iran was planning attacks on four US embassies when its top general was killed, President Donald Trump says. When asked what threat led to last Friday's US drone strike, he told Fox News: "I can reveal that I believe it probably would've been four embassies. The killing of Gen Qasem Soleimani, a national hero, came after days of protests at the US embassy in Baghdad. But Democrats given intelligence briefings on the fatal strike say they have seen no evidence of embassy plots. Mr Trump first made the embassy claim at the White House on Thursday and repeated it that night at a rally in Ohio. He was also backed up by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. We had specific information on an imminent threat and those included attacks on US embassies. Period, full stop, said Mr Pompeo as he announced new sanctions against Iran. Mr Trump referred to the US embassy protests as evidence of an imminent Iranian plot. However, those protests had ended by the time the US launched a drone attack on Soleimani's motorcade at the Baghdad airport.

3: BBC : UK : 11/01/2020: Sultan Qaboos of Oman, Arab world's longest-serving ruler, dies aged 79 :Foulen Ben Foulen : The sultan deposed his father in a bloodless coup with British support in 1970 and set Oman on a path to development, using its oil wealth. Widely regarded as popular, he was also an absolute monarch and any dissenting voices were silenced. No cause of death has been confirmed. His cousin Haitham bin Tariq Al Said has been sworn in as his successor. The former culture and heritage minister took the oath of office on Saturday after a meeting of the Royal Family Council, the government said. The sultan is the paramount decision-maker in Oman. He also holds the positions of prime minister, supreme commander of the armed forces, minister of defence, minister of finance and minister of foreign affairs. Last month Sultan Qaboos - who had no heir or designated successor - spent a week in Belgium for medical treatment, and there were reports he was suffering from cancer.With great sorrow and deep sadness... the royal court mourns His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who passed away on Friday," a court statement said earlier, announcing three days of national mourning. Images showed a crowed of men gathered outside the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in the capital, Muscat, where the casket had been taken and prayers were being held.
4: BBC : UK : 10/01/2020: Qasem Soleimani: Why his killing is good news for IS jihadists :Jeremy Bowen : The Islamic State (IS) group has welcomed the death of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds Force. In a statement, it described the general's demise as an act of divine intervention that benefitted jihadists. However, it made no mention at all of the US, which carried out the deadly drone strike against Soleimani in Baghdad on 3 January. President Donald Trump's decision to assassinate Gen Soleimani set off a chain of consequences - one of the first was on the unfinished war against jihadists. Almost immediately the US-led coalition fighting IS suspended operations in Iraq. The US and its allies announced that their main job was now defending themselves. From a military point of view, they probably had no choice. Iran and the militias it sponsors here in Iraq have sworn vengeance for the killings caused by the missile fired by a US drone at Soleimani's vehicle as it left Baghdad airport on Friday. That puts US forces in Iraq, and those from Western allies working alongside them, squarely in the firing line.It is also very good for IS, and will speed up its recovery from the blows it took when its caliphate was smashed. It is also good news for the extremists that the Iraqi parliament passed a motion demanding an immediate American withdrawal from the entire country.
5: France24 : France : 11/01/2020: Oman's Haitham sworn in as sultan after long-time leader Qaboos dies at 79 :Foulen Ben Foulen : Haitham bin Tariq, Oman's culture minister and the 65-year-old cousin of late Sultan Qaboos, has been sworn in as the new royal ruler, the government said Saturday. Haitham bin Tariq was sworn in as the new sultan of the country... after a meeting of the family which decided to appoint the one who was chosen by the sultan," the government said in a tweet. Oman's ailing Sultan Qaboos bin Said, one of the Middle East's longest serving rulers who maintained the country's neutrality in regional struggles, died on Friday and the Gulf state's high military council began the process to choose his successor. Qaboos, who died at the age of 79, was unmarried and had no children, and left no apparent heir. According to the Omani constitution, the royal family had three days to determine the successor and if they failed to agree, the person chosen by Qaboos in a letter addressed to the family would be the successor. Most experts had expected the throne to go to Asad bin Tariq, another cousin, who was appointed deputy prime minister for international relations and cooperation affairs in 2017 in what was seen as a clear message of support. Haitham, a sports enthusiast, held the position of undersecretary of the ministry of foreign affairs for political affairs before becoming the minister of heritage and culture in the mid-1990s.
6: France24 : France : 10/01/2020: Tunisia's parliament rejects PM-designate Jemli's proposed government :Foulen Ben Foulen : Jemli, an independent, was nominated by the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party after it came out on top in legislative polls in October but failed to win enough seats to form a majority in the 217-seat chamber. Deputies voted 134 to 72 against Jemli's proposed government of independent figures due to "frictions" between the parties over political appointments. President Kais Saied now has 10 days to choose a new prime minister-designate who will attempt to put together a government acceptable to the assembly. An agricultural engineer by training, Jemli served as secretary of state at the agriculture ministry from 2011 to 2014 under Ennahdha prime ministers Hamadi Jebali and Ali Larayedh.
7: France24 : France : 08/01/2020: Australia bushfires in numbers :Foulen Ben Foulen : At least 10.3 million hectares burned, an estimated billion animals killed and 400 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted. These are just some of the startling figures that reveal the scale and devastation caused by the ongoing bushfire crisis in Australia. Around 2,000 homes have been destroyed by the fires and at least 26 people killed as of Wednesday, January 8, with 129 fires still burning in New South Wales and another 40 blazes in the state of Victoria. Smoke from the fire has also travelled a remarkable distance, creating hazy skies 12,000 km away in South America. The recovery effort is also likely to produce some eye-watering numbers. The Australian government has already pledged A$2 billion to fund reconstruction efforts, while A$700 million worth of insurance claims have already been made to cover lost and damaged property.
8: France24 : France : 01/01/2020: Japan media blasts 'cowardly' Ghosn after escape :Foulen Ben Foulen : The usually staid Japanese media lambasted the "cowardly" Carlos Ghosn on Wednesday, after the tycoon jumped bail and fled to Lebanon to avoid trial in Japan. "Running away is a cowardly act that mocks Japan's justice system," said the Yomiuri Shimbun, with Ghosn facing multiple charges of financial misconduct -- all of which he denies. By leaving the country, Ghosn has "lost the opportunity to prove his innocence and vindicate his honour," the paper added, noting that the court, his defence lawyers and immigration control officials also bore some blame in the affair. The liberal Tokyo Shimbun also said Ghosn's actions had made a mockery of the Japanese justice system."The defendant Ghosn insists he escaped political persecution... but travelling abroad without permission is against the conditions of his bail, and mocks the Japanese justice system," the paper wrote. There is a high probability that the trial will not be held, and his argument that he wants to prove his innocence is now in question." Some media noted that the decision to give him bail -- seen by some as unusual at the time  now looks unwise. Prosecutors had argued at the time that he was a flight risk with powerful connections, but Ghosn himself had said he wanted to be tried to prove his innocence. One of his defence lawyers at the time has said he was such a famous face that there was no chance he would be able to slip away undetected. The conservative Sankei Shimbun noted that prosecutors believed the court had yielded to "foreign pressure" by offering him bail, amid widespread criticism in the global media of Japan's "hostage justice system" that allows for lengthy and repeated detention. In December 2018, the court declined prosecutors' request to extend Ghosn's detention by 10 days -- a surprising decision as the extension is usually almost automatic. And in fact Ghosn was bailed twice, once in March and a second time after he was re-arrested in April. All of these were rare decisions," said the Sankei. The centre-left Mainichi Shimbun quoted a senior prosecutor as saying: "This is what we predicted. This has ruined the prosecutors' painstaking work" of collecting evidence in Japan and abroad against him. The Asahi Shimbun also quoted a former Nissan executive voicing his disappointment at Ghosn's actions. The entrepreneur who ran Nissan for so many years and was well-known internationally turns out to be this kind of person. My jaw hit the floor. I can't find the words to express myself.
